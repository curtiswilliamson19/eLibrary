## Description
eLibrary is a virtual library application. Books and users on the application can be added, edited, and deleted. Books can also be taken out for loan by users on the application and overdue loans / books can be reported. There are also many business rules in place, including, but not limited to, not allowing duplicate users, not allowing loans that would conflict with one another, and not allowing users or books to be removed if they have an active loan. All data on the application is stored and taken from a database. This application was developed using C# (.Net Framework), WPF, and NHibernate (.Net Object-relational mapper).
